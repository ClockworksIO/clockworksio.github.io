intro:
  first: >-
    Your business is increasingly being measured by its ability to
    extract insights from diverse data streams, and by the speed at
    which it can feed those insights back into products and services.
  second: >-        
    We specialize in systems that produce accurate answers to complex
    questions in real-time, and the powerful web frontends that make
    them available to you and your users.

why:
  header: Our Language
  first: >-
    Great software emerges when a problem is not only identified, but
    when it can be formulated; when an idea is not merely thought, but
    articulated as a real solution; when a thought is described in such
    detail that even a machine can understand it.
  second: >-
    This is our language.
  third: >-
    We bridge the gap between business interest and the vast
    opportunities of the digital domain: be it as a consultant in
    creating new businesses or as a partner in solving complicated
    problems.
