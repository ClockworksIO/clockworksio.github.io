      Our core software solution, 3DF, is built fundamentally on differential- and timely dataflow
      and as such provides high performance in batch, stream and graph processing.
      We aspire to build a system that grants interactive access to fast changing, distributed datasets
      while incrementally maintaining potentially very expensive computations.
