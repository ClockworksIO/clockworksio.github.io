## Abstract

Imagine turning the way that web applications interact with the database on its head: instead of polling for changes, clients register their information interests and then continuously receive updates as new data enters the system. Can we do this while maintaining the power and flexibility of Datomic? This talk introduces 3DF, a stream processing system based on differential dataflows, which aims to do just that. Feeding off of Datomicâ€™s transaction log, 3DF provides a reactive interface to your favourite database, making it an even more attractive choice for the next generation of web applications.
