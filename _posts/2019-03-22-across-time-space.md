## Abstract

The functional approach to state management in the frontend was first enabled by React, pioneered by the likes of om.next, Redux, and Elm, and has ushered in a golden era in web development. It is captured by the two signatures `view :: DB -> HTML` and `mutate :: DB -> Tx -> DB`. What might happen when we start working with more than one world, i.e. when we replace the notion of mutate with that of `solve :: DB -> Tx -> [DB]`?

Using Clojure and Rust, we explore these ideas in the context of 3DF, a stream processing system based on differential dataflows.
